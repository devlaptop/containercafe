  "body": "### Welcome to ContainerCafe!\r\nContainer Cafe is a modular platform for enterprise container-native devops. The OpenRadiant platform can be subsetted and/or extended to create the solution you desire.\r\n\r\nFeatures of the ContainerCafe platform include:\r\n\r\n-  Kubernetes\r\n-  Swarm (original, not \"swarm mode\" introduced in Docker 1.12)\r\n-  Mesos\r\n-  Multi-tenancy - with or without Bring-Your-Own-IPv4\r\n-  Multi-sharding\r\n-  HA control plane in each shard\r\n-  Ansible-based create/update/destroy tooling\r\n-  Support for a variety of sources of authentication\r\n-  Control plane secured by TLS\r\n-  Support for a variety of Software-Defined-Network technologies\r\n-  Live container crawling\r\n\r\nContainerCafe is a work in progress. The above features are not yet available in all combinations..\r\n\r\n### ContainerCafe Architecture\r\nContainerCafe is software that you can subset and/or extend to produce software that you use to operate an enterprise container-native devops service.\r\nOne operating instantiation of the full platform is called an environment, and it contains one or more shards that operate independently of each other. Each shard provides Kubernetes, Swarm, and/or Mesos service. There is an outer control plane with a proxy API server that implements the Kubernetes and Swarm APIs --- with appropriate restrictions and extensions --- by appropriately transforming each RPC and dispatching it to the appropriate shard.\r\nYou can subset ContainerCafe so that it creates just one shard and there is no API proxy.\r\n\r\n### Why ContainerCafe?\r\n\r\nContainerCafe aggregates the functionality of several open source container management solutions, and complements them with the added value of automated deployment, multi-tenancy, high availability, security, enhanced visibility, etc. \r\n\r\n![ContainerCafe](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-containers/openradiant/blob/master/docs/media/2016-08.ContainerCafeFeatures.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing to the project\r\nWe welcome contributions to the OpenRadiant Project in many forms.
