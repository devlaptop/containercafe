# These specify the virtual IP address (VIP) and subnet to use for the
# load balancing across copies of the master components.  The tiny
# example exercises the mechanisms for HA deployment of replicated
# master components --- where the number of each is 1.  See
# ../../../docs/ansible.md#ansible-variables for the general story
# about these varaibles and ??? for the general story about HA
# deployment.
