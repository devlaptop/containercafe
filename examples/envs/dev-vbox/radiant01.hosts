# The inventory for the tiny example.  This is just one way to provide
# inventory.  See ../../../docs/ansible.md#the-inventory-contract for
# the general story.

# In this example we put all the master components on one VM.  In an
# example that is not tiny you would have multiple machines running
# master components.  This example illustrates one approach to that,
# in which every master component runs on every master machine (this
# example just happens to have only a single master machine).  Other
# approaches are possible.  See ???  for the general story about HA
# deployments.

# The following inventory group defines the set of master machines.
# This group is not required by the inventory contract, but we use it
# here to make the independence between the components clear.

# The following inventory group defines the set of worker machines.
# Note that the shard name, which includes the environment name, is a
# critical part of this group name.  The shard name is
# "dev-vbox-radiant01", and the environment name is "dev-vbox".  An
# environment name must have exactly one dash in it, and a shard name
# can use only lower case letters, digits, and dashes.  See
# ../../../docs/ansible.md#the-inventory-contract for more details.

# The remaining inventory groups state that each of the master
# components is deployed on each of the master machines.  As noted
# above, other layouts are possible.
