You can define your own configuration by making a copy of this folder and setting the value of the environment variable `ENV_NAME`
to the name of the folder before running `vagrant up`. For the tiny example `ENV_NAME` is `dev-vbox`.
In the tiny example, the shard is named `dev-vbox-radiant01`:

Includes the groups and the IP addresses of the machines.

#####radiant01.yml
